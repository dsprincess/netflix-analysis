# netflix_analysis

Ongoing
---
In this project, I'm trying to analyze movies and shows on Netflix, initially using SQL (MySQL).
Then, I'll be using PowerBI and Tableau as visualization tools inorder to have a comparison on the pros and cons of both.
I'm planning to do analysis in Python for the title descriptions to get some insights.
