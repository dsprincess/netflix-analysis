# netflix_analysis

Ongoing
---
In this project, I'm trying to analyze movies and shows on Netflix, initially using SQL (MySQL).
Then, I'll be using PowerBI and Tableau as visualization tools in order to compare the pros and cons of both.
Lastly, I'm planning to do some analysis in Python for the title descriptions to get some insights.
