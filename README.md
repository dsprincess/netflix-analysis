# Netflix Movies and Shows Analysis

Ongoing
---
In this project, I analyzed Netflix movies and shows using SQL (MySQL) for the initial data exploration. I then created visualizations with both Tableau and Power BI to compare their effectiveness and usability.

While both tools handle data preparation similarly for this dataset, my choice between them often comes down to personal familiarity and preference. Tableau offers advanced visualization options but comes with a steep learning curve, whereas Power BI has an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier to create dashboards and reports quickly. I initially started with Tableau, which presented some challenges in dashboard creation. However, since I became more familiar with the data, I found Power BI easier to use for this project. Ultimately, I discovered that both BI tools are excellent in their own ways.

Looking ahead, I plan to extend this analysis by exploring Netflix title descriptions using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to uncover deeper insights.
