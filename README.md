# netflix_analysis

Ongoing
---
In this project, I'm trying to analyze movies and shows on Netflix, initially using SQL (MySQL).
I'm already done creating visualizations using Tableau and next is through using Power BI.

At the end of this project, I will compare the pros and cons of both the visualization tools.
Lastly, I'm planning to do some analysis in Python for the title descriptions using nlp to get some insights.
